TODO LIST
=========

conformity
----------
 - implement immutable pairs, symbols, strings, improve management of immutables
   (idea: take the spare pointer for immutable pairs)

fixes
-----
 - documentation
 - fix USE_MATH
 - improve symbol print
 - detecting errors in define-record-type
 - modify mk_atom to not use fold with fixed length

features
--------
 - MORE C FUNCTION FOR INTERFACE (NUMBERS)
 - implement abstraction for ports -> user defined ports
 - finalize number tower (big integers, rationals, complexes)
 - candidate built-in SRFI:
     - 111 (boxes)
     - 151 (bit ops)
     - 13 (strings)
     - 4 (vectors)
     - 181 (ports)
      ... ?
 - save internal program/image
 - extendable equal? from list of (predicate . compare): (and (predicate a) (predicate b) (compare a b))
 - improve tr7i.scm

optimisation
------------
 - automatic and systematic check of predefined procedures slow down things
   example: reverse require that the list is proper so (1) check proper,
   (2) reverse but if detection is made in the procedure, it would be fastest.
   Also for math, it make sense to check when processing, not before.
